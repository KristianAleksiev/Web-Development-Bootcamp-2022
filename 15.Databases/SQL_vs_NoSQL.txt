SQL vs NoSQL:

1. Structure
-SQL Databases - Table structure
-SQL Databases are older, structured and reliable, Schema required
-SQL Database groups data into tables
-SQL Databases are not flexible
-SQL Databases inputs Null for every field missing

-NoSQL Databases - Document structure
-NoSQL Databases - JSON objects, key value pairs
-NoSQL Databases - More flexible to changes

2. Data relations
-SQL - Good at establishing data relations - Group related piece of data into individual tables(customer, products, orders)
-NoSQL - Embedded objects, data repetition, not great with complex relations

3. Scalability
-NoSQL - Strong Scalability, preferred with bigger data structure, distributed system of data is possible
-NoSQL - Scales horizontally
-SQL - Scales vertically
-SQL - Getting slower with more data
